He was also a popular figure, and his name became synonymous with genius. His image has been used in countless ways, from cartoons to merchandise, and he is often ranked as one of the most influential people of the 20th century.\n\nEinstein died on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76. His legacy continues to inspire scientists and non-scientists alike, and his ideas continue to shape our understanding of the universe.'}, error=None, latency_ms=116625, stability_signal=1.0)
